# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

##  Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

##  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## Program
```
add = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
z = int(input())
result = add(x, y, z)
print(result)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully.
